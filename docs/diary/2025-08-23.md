# Record Manager

## Works

## Notes

- Unspanned vs Spanned blocks. Spanned means a record could be placed in multiple blocks, while Unspanned means it can only be placed in a single block. I choose **Unspanned**.
- Nonhomogeneous vs Homogeneous files. Nonhomogeneous means a file can contain different types of data, while Homogeneous means it can only contain one type. I choose **Nonhomogeneous**.
- Fixed-Length vs Variable-Length fields. Fixed-Length means a field has a set size, while Variable-Length means it can change size.
- The machine code to access an integer requires that the integer be stored in a memory location that is a multiple of 4 -> therefore some fields need to be padded
- Fragmented issue happen when we delete a record then we cannot insert a new record in the same location that has greater size. Smaller size is ok but its also cause of fragmented -> Think about PostgreSQL implementation, addresses is at the beginning, values is at the end of the block? -> solution for variable-length records
