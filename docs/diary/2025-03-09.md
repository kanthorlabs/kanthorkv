# Implement file manager

## Works

- Implement the file manager
- Implement error message pattern

## Notes

- Always open file with a flag/mode that ignores disk optimization. It's critical for implementing the data recovery algorithm.
- Read/write entirely blocks of data to only perform one disk operation. It's critical for performance.
- Using file locking to optimize file access
