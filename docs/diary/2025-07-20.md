# Implement Transaction Manager

## Works

- Implement the Concurrency Manager

## Notes

- We always need to obtain SLock whenever we acquire an XLock to make sure both lock escalation and lock queue work well 
- XLock is stronger than SLock, then if we already have a XLock, we don't need to obtain SLock again

## TODOs
