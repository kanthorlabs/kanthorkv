# Database memory management

## Works

## Notes

- Principles: minimize disk accesses, and donâ€™t rely on virtual memory.
- Buffer pool: a memory area that caches data pages.
- OPtimize log written to disk: 
    - push a record to a page, no room in that page, flush the page to disk, then append log to that page.
    - order write a log to disk, if it's in a page, flush that page to disk.
