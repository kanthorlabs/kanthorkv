# Implement Transaction Manager

## Works

- Implement the Transaction Manager

## Notes

- ACID
    - The atomicity and durability properties describe the proper behavior of the commit and rollback operations. 
    - The consistency and isolation properties describe the proper behavior of concurrent clients.
- Database reasonable state
    - All uncompleted transactions should be rolled back.
    - All committed transactions should have their modi cations written to disk.
- Quiescent Checkpointing: stop point that 
    - All earlier log records were written by completed transactions.
    - The buffers for those transactions have been ushed to disk.
