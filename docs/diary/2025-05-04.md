# Managing User Data

## Works

- Implemented a buffer manager to manage the buffer pool

## Notes

- Four cases will happen to the buffer pool
    - one page is using by multiple clients (concurrency manage is handled by concurrency manager)
    - client have done their work, but page does not assign to another client yet, so that buffer pool can reuse the page
    - buffer manager has to read the block from disk: select unpinned page, flush the page if it has modified, then read the block into the page and pin it
    - buffers are haveily used, so that buffer manager place the client on a wait list
- Replace pages strategies
    - Na√Øve: replace sequentially
    - FIFO: chose least recently replaced buffer. Two ways to  implement: hold last replaced time or pointer list ordered by reaplcement time
    - LRU: buffer that was last accessed. Implement as same as FIFO but need to update the timestamp in both ways
    - Clock: scan through the buffer pool, select the first unpinned page. Next scan will be started after the last repacled buffer

## TODOs

- Consider using `sync.RWMutex` for read-write locks
