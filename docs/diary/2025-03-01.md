# Implement page and block_id

## Works

- init project
- form first implementation of disk and file mangement

## Notes

- Disk access measurement = seek time + rotational delay + transfer time
- Estimated time to access 1000 bytes: 5 ms (seek) + 3 ms (rotational delay) + 0.012 ms (transfer) = 8.012 ms
- Learn about binary.LittleEndian: binary.LittleEndian.PutUint64 works correctly for negative numbers
