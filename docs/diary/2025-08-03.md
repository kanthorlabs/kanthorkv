# Implement Transaction

## Works

- Implement transaction struct

## Notes

- The sequence of operations performed by the transactions in the engine is called a schedule. A schedule is serializable if it is equivalent to a serial schedule

    -> Only serializable schedules are correct.
- All transactions to follow the lock protocol, which states:

    – Before reading a block, acquire a shared lock on it.

    – Before modifying a block, acquire an exclusive lock on it.

    – Release all locks after commit or rollback.
